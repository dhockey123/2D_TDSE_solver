2D TDSE Solver
===============================
# About

A two-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation visualiser that illustrates the dynamics of a gaussian wavepacket scattered off of different potential fields.

Numerical solutions to the TDSE can be obtained by using an ADI or Pseudospectral FFT based method.


# Usage

Using Ctrl+a and Ctrl+Enter in VSCode from "main.jl" is the recommended way to run the code. Does NOT work directly from terminal ( This might just be my system though ). 



User interaction is enabled for specifying the following,

### Domain parameters
```
N     : Number of grid points along each axis ( N = Nx = Ny )
t_max : Simulated runtime
x, x  : Boundary points of domain along x-axis
y, y  : Boundary points of domain along y-axis
```
The time step is dependent on the value Δx, such that Δt = 0.5Δx^2. This is done to ensure numerical stability for the ADI solver, more details can be found in referenced article.

### Wave parameters
```
σx, σy   : Initial spatial spread 
kx, ky   : Initial wavenumber
x_0, y_0 : Coordinates wave packet is centered at 
```

### Potential Field 
```
Potential well

Barrier
    - pos   : position double slit barrier is centered at
    - gap   : slit size
    - width : width of barrier

Cylinder 
    - x, y  : position potential is centered at
    - r     : radius of circle/cylinder
    - |U|   : magnitude of potential field
```
